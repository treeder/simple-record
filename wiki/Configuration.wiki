===Domain Prefix===
To set a global prefix across all your models, use:
{{{
SimpleRecord::Base.set_domain_prefix("myprefix_")
}}}

===Connection Modes===

There are 4 different connection modes:

  * per_request (default) - opens and closes a new connection to simpledb for every simpledb request. Not the best performance, but it's safe and can handle many concurrent requests at the same time (unlike single mode).
  * single - one connection across the entire application, not recommended unless the app is used by a single person.
  * per_thread - a connection is used for every thread in the application. This is good, but the catch is that you have to ensure to close the connection.
  * pool - NOT IMPLEMENTED YET - opens a maximum number of connections and round robins them for any simpledb request. 

We recommend per_thread with explicitly closing the connection after each Rails request (not to be mistaken for a SimpleDB request) or pool for rails apps.

For rails, be sure to add this to your Application controller if using per_thread mode:

{{{
after_filter :close_sdb_connection

  def close_sdb_connection
    RightAws::ActiveSdb.close_connection
  end
}}}
