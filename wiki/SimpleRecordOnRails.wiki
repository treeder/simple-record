You don't really have to do anything except have your models extends SimpleRecord::Base instead of ActiveRecord::Base, but here are some tips you can use.

==Change Connection Mode==

Use per_thread connection mode and close the connection after each request.

{{{
after_filter :close_sdb_connection

  def close_sdb_connection
    RightAws::ActiveSdb.close_connection
  end
}}}

==Disable ActiveRecord so you don't have to setup another database==

This is most helpful on windows so Rails doesn't need sqlite or mysql gems/drivers installed which are painful to install on windows. In environment.rb, add 'config.frameworks -= [ :active_record ]', should look something like:

{{{
Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
  config.frameworks -= [ :active_record ] 
  ....
end
}}}
