==Automagic Stuff==

===Automatic common fields===
 
Every object will automatically get the following attributes so you don't need to define them:

* id - UUID string
* created - set when first save
* updated - set every time you save/update

===belongs_to foreign keys/IDs are accessible without touching the database===

If you had the following in your model:

{{{
belongs_to :something
}}}

Then in addition to being able to access the something object with:

{{{
o.something
}}}

or setting it with:

{{{ 
o.something = someo
}}}

You can also access the ID for something directly with:

{{{
o.something_id
}}}

or

{{{
o.something_id = x
}}}
